<h1>SM64GSW</h1> 
<p>by Alex Free.</p>

<p>SuperMario64GameSharkWriter is an open source <a href="#license">3-BSD</a> command line program written in C that writes GameShark/Xploder64 codes into a Super Mario 64 USA ROM (must be .z64/big endian format), and modifies the CRC check if neccesary (making this an alternatie to the CHKSUM64 program) allowing edited ROMs to boot in <a href="#emu_compat">emulators</a>. Unlike the old CHKSUM64 program the ROM will work in Mupen64Plus and many other emulators.</p>

<p>SM64GSW performs Messiaen64's ROM hex editing methods written at <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/patching-gameshark-codes>Patching GameShark Codes</a> and <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/getting-rid-of-the-checksum-trap>Getting Rid Of The Checksum Trap</a> in software automatically so you don't have to hex edit your SM64 ROM manually. You want to use the ROM file most likely named 'Super_Mario_64__U_____.z64' with this software. The .z64 rom file type is big endian, which is required.</p>

<a name=compat><h2>Supported Operating Systems</h2></a>

<p>The win32 version works on Windows 95 OSR 2.5 and newer (Requires Internet Explorer 4.0 installed if using Windows 95). There are Linux versions for x86 32 bit and x86_64 64 bit which should work on most distros. Other Operating Systems that use little endian CPUs (such as ARM, x86, x86_64) can be compiled for from <a href="#install_source">source</a>.</p>

<a name=code_compat><h2>GameShark Code Compatibility</h2></a>

<p>The supported codes types are 80, A0, F0, 81, A1, and 2A. Code types are defined by the first 2 hexadecimal digits of a code. For example, in the level select code 'A032D58C 0001' 'A0' is the code type. SM64GSW will not write incompatible code types to the ROM, and it will tell you if this happens. In a multi-line code, this could happen after the first line, which would mean only part of the multi-line code was written to ROM possibly making it unusable. In such a case, you should replace the ROM file.

<p>There is a work in progress <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex-free/sm64gsw/main/known_working_codes.txt>Known Working Codes</a> list. The Supported RAM range is 80246000-80333000. The 3rd-8th digits of a code must be a hexadecimal value in the range of 246000-333000 to work. Not all N64 GameShark/Xploder64 code types are supported. This is due to certain code types not translating into just hex writes for various reasons, such as codes that:
<ul><li>Require physical hardware (like a GS button).</li>
<li>Perform live checks and or dynamic modification.</li>
<li>Expansion pack releated.</li>
<li>Non-Super Mario 64 security chip related.</li></ul>

<p>Besides the above limitations, some codes may not work as they normally do so you'll need to just test them out.</p>

<a name=emu_compat><h2>Emulator Compatibility</h2>

<p>1964, Mupen64, and Mupen64Plus will run the resulting edited ROMs as normal. Other emulators may display error messages on loading the ROM but still work. Nemu64 0.8 will display an error message "Unknown bootcode. Chances that this game won't work are high". Project 64 1.6 will display two error messages. "Unknown Cic Chip" and "Unhandled CicChip(-1) in first DMA". Other emulators were not tested, but any really should work. Have no idea about a real console.</p>

<a name=usage><h2>Usage</h2></a>

<p>This is a command line program, so on Windows you can open command.com or cmd.exe to execute sm64gsw.exe. On other Operating Systems use the Terminal. There are 3 main features.</p>

<p><b>Note that if any file paths given to SM64GSW contain any spaces you must escape (\) the spaces as done in the examples below.</b></p>

<a name=modify_cic><h3>Modify CIC Check In ROM</h3></a>

<p>This functionallity can be used as an alternative to the CHKSUM64 program. CHKSUM64 will try to correct the CIC check but the ROMs it modifies do not load in all emulators, most notably Mupen64Plus. The method SM64GSW uses will however work in Mupen64Plus and all the emulators CHKSUM64 worked in as well. So if you want to bypass the CIC check in your ROM file and not write any codes, use -m as your first argument, and the ROM file path as the second argument. Note that this function is automatically performed if neccesary when GameShark codes that cause the CIC Check to fail are written to a ROM file by SM64GSW. So you do not need to do this if you are writing codes to a ROM.<p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<code>sm64gsw -m rom.z64</code>
<p>Bypass CIC check in the file "rom.z64" found in the current directory.</p>
<code>sm64gsw -m /path\ to/rom.z64</code>
<p>Bypass CIC check in the file "/path to/rom.z64".</p>

<a name=write_codes><h3>Write GameShark Codes Listed In A TXT File To ROM</h3></a>

<p>SM64GSW can write GameShark codes listed in a txt file line by line. To do this, you have to provide 3 total arguments to run SM64GSW in txt file mode. The first argument is the ROM file path, the second is the TXT file path. The TXT file should simply list each code line by line. An example of this is the "gs.txt" file within this release.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<code>sm64gsw rom.z64 codes.txt</code>
<p>Write all codes found in the "codes.txt" file to the ROM file "rom.z64", both found in the current directory.</p>
<code>sm64gsw ex\ am\ ple/rom.z64 ex\ am\ ple/codes.txt</code>
<p>Write all codes found in the "ex am ple/codes.txt" file to the ROM file "ex\ am\ ple/rom.z64".</p>

<a name=type_codes><h3>Type GameShark Codes To ROM</h3></a>

<p>There is an interface to type codes into a ROM as well. To do this, just execute sm64gsw with the ROM file path as the only argument. For multi-line codes, you can enter each code line by line, one at a time.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<code>sm64gsw rom.z64</code>
<p>Load the ROM file "rom.z64" in the current directory to type codes to write.</p>
<code>sm64gsw /full/file\ path/to/rom.z64</code>
<p>Load the ROM file "/full/file path/rom.z64" to type codes to write.</p>

<a name=install_source><h2>Install From Source</h2></a>

<p>This software is written to run on any ANSI-C platform with a little endian CPU. Builds for Linux and Windows are available. Other Unix-like Operating Systems should also work (including Intel/ARM Macs). Really, this software is as easy to compile as <code>gcc sm64gsw.c -o sm64gsw</code>. A GNU Makefile is provided that will do just that by default, when executing <code>make</code>. There are some additional rules to make various tasks easier to accomplish listed below.</p>

<p>Compile a static 32 bit Linux build.<p>
<code>make linux-static32</code> 

<p>Compile a static 64 bit Linux build.<p>
<code>make linux-static64</code>

<p>Cross compile using the i686-w64-mingw32-gcc compiler for Windows 95 OSR 2.5 and above (requires Internet Explorer 4.0 to be installed if running on Windows 95).</p>
<code>make cross-win32</code>

<p>Cross compile using the x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc compiler for any 64 bit Windows.</p>
<code>make cross-win64</code>

<a name=known_issues><h2>Known Issues</h2></a>

<ul><li>Only little endian CPUs are supported, big endian (such as old PowerPC) does not work.</li></ul>
